\title{EigenDog's \texttt{dawg}}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

EigenDog's implementation of {\bf Gradient Boosting Trees}, called
\texttt{dawg} follows the mathematical description in Friedman's 1999
paper \cite{GBM}.

Following Friedman's notation, our training set is represented by
$(y_i, \vx_i)$ where $i = 1 \ldots n$: We have $n$ records, each
record $i$ consists of an outcome (aka response) $y_i$ and feature
vector $\vx_i$.  In the general \texttt{dawg} formulation the objective is to
minimize the loss function $Q$:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{objective}
Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n} L(y_i, F(\vx_i))
\end{equation}
%
In this context context, $y \in \{ -1, 1 \}$ and
%
\[
L(y,F) = \log ( 1 + \exp( -2 y F ) )
\]
$L$ is know as the {\bf deviance} or {\bf cross-entropy.}  $F$ is the
object we want to construct.  The probability of classifications are:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
p(y =1|\vx) &= \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-2 F(\vx) )} \\
p(y =-1|\vx) &= 1 - p(y=1|\vx) = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(2 F(\vx) )} \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Some intuition about function $L(y,F)$:
first, $\log( 1 + \exp (\bullet) )$ is always positive, since
$\exp(\bullet) \ge 0$.  When $y=1$ and $F \rightarrow \infty$, the
quantity $\exp ( -2 y F ) \rightarrow 0$ and $L(y, F) \rightarrow 0$.
So, to drive $L(y, F)$ closer to zero (which is its floor) when
$y_i=1$, we want to increase $F$.  Similarly, when $y=-1$, decreasing
$F \rightarrow -\infty$ drives $L(y, F)$ closer to zero.  In either
case, increasing the magnitude of $F$ in the same direction as $y$
reduces $L(y,F)$.  Similarly, when $y$ and $F$ have opposite signs and
$| F | \rightarrow \infty$ then $L(y,F) \rightarrow \infty$.

In \texttt{dawg}, the function $F(\vx)$ is a sum of $K+1$ decision trees:
\[
F(\vx) = \sum_{k=0}^K F_k(\vx)
\]
More precisely, each $F_k(\vx)$ is a binary decision trees, so that
each of its non-leaf nodes has two child trees, called the {\bf left}
and {\bf right} sub-trees.  A decision tree is a piecewise constant
function, where a leaf node represents one of the constant pieces, and
a non-leaf node represent a decision over the value of a single
feature $\vx^j$.  (Notation: whereas $\vx_i$ is the $i$-th row of the
training set, $\vx^j$ is the $j$-th feature/column).

The ``boosting'' in \texttt{dawg} refers to the fact that in each iteration $k$,
a new decision tree is constructed that improves upon the previously
constructed function defined by the sequence of trees $F_0, \ldots,
F_{k-1}$.  The essential (and inductive) question in \texttt{dawg} is: having
constructed these trees, what ought the {\em next} tree be?

\paragraph{Feature Splitting}

To build the next tree, we must partition the population of records
into two subsets.  To build deeper trees, we must recursively
partition each subset.  With each recursion, we must answer the
question: were we to stop recursion here -- and therefore build a pair
of leaf nodes -- what would be their constant values?  We denote the
leaf's constant value as $\gamma$, with $\gamma_L$ being the left
value, and $\gamma_R$ being the right one.  Over a subset of records
$S$, we want to choose a value for $\gamma$ so that the loss function
in equation [\ref{objective}] is minimized.  For each record $i$ in
$S$, $\gamma$ would be added to sum of the all previously constructed
trees $F_k(\vx_i)$.  So our goal is to find a $\gamma^*$:
%
\[
\gamma^* = \arg \min_\gamma \sum_{i \in S} L
  \bigg[
    y_i, \bigg\{ \sum_{k=0}^K F_k(\vx_i) \bigg\} + \gamma
  \bigg]
\]
To simplify the presentation, we'll define $F_i^K \equiv \sum_{k=0}^K
F_k(\vx_i)$, which is the value of the record $i$ evaluated over the
sum of all the decision trees constructed thus far:
%
\[
\gamma^* = \arg \min_\gamma \sum_{i \in S} L
  \bigg[ y_i, F_i^K + \gamma \bigg]
\]
%
Finding the best $\gamma$, $\gamma^*$, is univariate minimization
problem because $y_i$ and $F_i^K$ are all fixed.  Furthermore, it
turns out that we don't need the optimal $\gamma^*$, just a decent
approximation $\hat \gamma \approx \gamma^*$.  In his paper, Friedman
declares (without giving proof) that this approximation is:
\[
\hat \gamma =
  \frac { \sum_{i \in S} z_i } { \sum_{i \in S} | z_i | ( 2 - | z_i | ) }
\]
where
\[
z_i \equiv \frac{ 2 y_i } { 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] }
\]
are called the {\em pseudo-response}.

\paragraph{Proof}

The proof is as follows: we model $Q(\gamma)$ using a local quadratic
approximation defined by the Taylor series expansion.  The textbook
definition of a Taylor series expansion centered at zero (actually
known as the Maclaurin series) is:
\[
f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + f''(0)x^2/2! + \cdots
\]
Applying this to $Q(\gamma)$, we have:
\begin{equation*}
Q(\gamma) = Q(0) + Q'(0)\gamma + Q''(0)\gamma^2/2! + \cdots \\
\end{equation*}
Then dropping the higher-order terms, we have the quadratic
approximation:
\begin{equation}
Q(\gamma) \approx Q(0) + Q'(0)\gamma + Q''(0)\gamma^2/2! \\
\label{Q-quad}
\end{equation}

Since we are no longer minimizing $Q(\gamma)$ exactly, but rather an
approximation of that function, the resulting $\hat \gamma$ will be
also be an approximation of the true minimizer $\gamma^*$.  The
minimizer of $Q(\gamma)$ must satisfy $Q'(\hat \gamma)=0$, and, taking
this first derivative results in the condition $Q'(0) + Q''(0)\hat
\gamma = 0$ or
\[
\hat \gamma = -\frac{ Q'(0) }{ Q''(0) }
\]
This approximation might initially seem crude. However, one must view
this in the context of the broader \texttt{dawg} algorithm, in which each new
decision tree addresses the shortcomings of the previous ones.
Therefore, a crude selection of $\gamma$ in one branch of one tree is
corrected in the tree-building iterations that follow it.  In fact,
since the \texttt{dawg} model improves with each new tree, we expect the leaf
values necessary to make further improvements to shrink in magnitude.
In other words, as $k \rightarrow \infty$, $\gamma \rightarrow 0$.

We now derive expressions for $Q'(0)$ and $Q''(0)$:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q'(\gamma) &= \frac {\partial Q}{\partial \gamma} \\
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma} \sum_{i \in S} L \bigg[ y_i, F_i^K + \gamma \bigg] \\
&= \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma} \sum_{i \in S} \log \big( 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma} \log \big( 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \big( 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big)^{-1} \frac{\partial}{\partial \gamma} \big( 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \big( 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big)^{-1}  \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \big( -2 y_i \big) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{  \big( -2 y_i \big) \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } { 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{  -2 y_i \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } { 1 + \exp [ -2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } \times
   \frac { \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } { \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] } \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ -2 y_i } { \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 } \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Now the second derivative:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q''(\gamma) &= \frac {\partial Q'}{\partial \gamma} \\
&= \frac {\partial}{\partial \gamma} \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ -2 y_i } { \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 } \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} (-2 y_i ) \frac {\partial}{\partial \gamma} \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 \bigg)^{-1} \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} (-2 y_i ) (-1) \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 \bigg)^{-2} \frac {\partial}{\partial \gamma} \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 \bigg) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} (-2 y_i ) (-1) \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 \bigg)^{-2} \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] ( 2 y_i ) \\
&= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ (2 y_i)^2 } { \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] + 1 \bigg)^2 } \times \exp [ 2 y_i (F_i^K + \gamma) ] \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

Since we are interested in $Q'(0)$, $Q''(0)$, we now simplify with
$\gamma=0$:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q'(0) &= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ -2 y_i } { \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] + 1 } = - \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ 2 y_i } { \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] + 1 } \\
Q''(0) &= \sum_{i \in S} \frac{ (2 y_i)^2 } { \bigg( \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] + 1 \bigg)^2 } \times \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Then, conveniently defining
\begin{equation*}
z_i \equiv \frac{ 2 y_i } { 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] }
\end{equation*}
we get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q'(0) &= - \sum_{i \in S} z_i \\
Q''(0) &= \sum_{i \in S} z_i^2 \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
Note from the definition of $z_i$ that $2 y_i = z_i ( 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i
  F_i^K ] )$ and therefore $\exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] = 2y_i/z_i - 1 =
(2y_i - z_i)/z_i$.  So,
\begin{equation*}
Q''(0) = \sum_{i \in S} z_i^2 \frac{ 2 y_i - z_i }{ z_i } = \sum_{i \in S} z_i ( 2 y_i - z_i ) = \sum_{i \in S} ( 2 y_i z_i - z_i^2 )
\end{equation*}
Also note that
\begin{equation*}
y_i z_i = y_i \frac{ 2 y_i } { 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] } = \frac{ 2 y_i^2 } { 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] }
\end{equation*}
However, since $y_i$ is always either $1$ or $-1$, $y_i^2 = 1$, and so
$y_i z_i = | z_i |$.  Substituting this into $Q''(0)$, we have
\begin{equation*}
Q''(0) = \sum_{i \in S} ( 2 | z_i | - z_i^2 ) = \sum_{i \in S} ( 2 | z_i | - | z_i | ^2 ) = \sum_{i \in S} | z_i | ( 2 - | z_i | )
\end{equation*}
Finally, we can confirm Friedman's approximation for the optimal $\gamma$:
\begin{equation*}
\hat \gamma
  = - \frac{ Q'(0) }{ Q''(0) }
  = - \frac{ - \sum_{i \in S} z_i }{ \sum_{i \in S} | z_i | ( 2 - | z_i | ) }
  = \frac{ \sum_{i \in S} z_i }{ \sum_{i \in S} | z_i | ( 2 - | z_i | ) }
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Optimal Loss}

I'll define $N$ and $D$ denoting numerator and denominator:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
N(S) &= \sum_{i \in S} z_i \\
D(S) &= \sum_{i \in S} | z_i | ( 2 - | z_i | ) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
and then $\hat \gamma = N(S)/D(S)$.

The non-leaf nodes in the tree we are constructing are labeled with
the identity of a feature $x^j$ and a rule for deciding whether
evaluation should proceed to the left or right sub-tree.  For features
that are ordered, this decision takes the form of $x^j \le \alpha$
(where $\alpha =$ is also known as the {\bf split}.  A split
partitions a population of records into two subsets $S_L$ and its
complement $S_R$.  For each subset, we can compute $\gamma_L$ and
$gamma_R$ resp., which would reveal the leaf values for a branch of
the decision tree.  we could also determine what the loss of
population of records would be under the split:
\[
Q(\hat \gamma) = Q_L( \hat \gamma_L) + Q_R( \hat \gamma_R ) =
\sum_{i \in S_L} L [ y_i, F_i^K + \gamma_L ] +
\sum_{i \in S_R} L [ y_i, F_i^K + \gamma_R ]
\]
A feature with $M$ distinct values has $M-1$ candidate splits.  By
evaluating $Q(\hat \gamma)$ for each the candidate splits (and
correspondingly, the partition $S_L$ and $S_R$ that would result from
the split), we can identify a split associated with the minimum loss
$Q$.  Similarly, determining the optimum split and corresponding loss
of each feature in the training set, we can identify the feature
associated with the minimum loss.  Exhaustively determining $\gamma$
and the resulting loss for each candidate split and for each feature
is the key computation in \texttt{dawg}.

Computing $Q(\hat \gamma)$ exactly is expensive; fortunately our local
quadratic approximation \ref{Q-quad} is already available:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Q(\hat \gamma) &\approx
  Q(0) +
  \hat \gamma ( - N ) +
  \frac{1}{2} \hat \gamma^2 ( D ) \\
&= Q(0) + \frac{N}{D} (-N) +   \frac{1}{2} \big( \frac{N}{D} \big)^2 ( D ) \\
&= Q(0) - \frac{N^2}{D} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{N^2}{D} \\
&= Q(0) - \frac{1}{2} \frac{N^2}{D}
\end{split}
\end{equation*}


\paragraph{Ordinal Features}

For an ordered feature, we can efficiently compute $\hat \gamma$ and
loss $Q(\hat \gamma)$ for all possible splits.  For example, the 11-th
feature $\vx^{11}$ of a training set consisting of 7 records is
$\vx^{11} = [5,1000,21,5,1000,5,5]^T$.  $\vx^{11}$ has three distinct
values $\{5,21,1000\}$, and correspondingly, two possible splits:
$x^{11} \le 5$ and $x^{11} \le 21$.  We want to determine which of
these splits would result in lower loss.  Assuming $Q(0)$ is evaluated
identically for all features, We now need to compute $N_{\{i| x^{11}
  \le 5\}}$, $N_{\{i| x^{11} \le 21\}}$, $D_{\{i| x^{11} \le 5\}}$,
$D_{\{i| x^{11} \le 21\}}$.

\paragraph{Deep Trees}

A decision tree consisting of one root node and two leaves is called a
{\bf stump}.  Typically, we want to grow deeper decision trees, as
this will better capture interaction-effects among features.  To build
sub-trees, we simply capture the splitting feature and value and apply
the same tree-building logic on the partition of records defined by
the split.  When only terminate the tree with leaves once the depth of
the tree has reached a user-specified limit.

We must maintain the partition (of partition of ...) over which a best
split is to be searched.  For trees whose depth is greater than one
(non-stumps), the ancestor split along with its feature data is
necessary in order to assign a record to a descendant partition.

\paragraph{Categorical Features}

Categorical features are defined by some finite number of labels.  For
example, the feature {\em nationality} might have three categories
(aka class labels) \texttt{French}, \texttt{American}, and
\texttt{Panamanian}.  The categories of such a feature have no natural
ordering.  A decision rule for a categorical feature $x^j$ takes the
form $x^j \in C_L$ where $C_L$ is a subset of the categories of that
feature.  For example, \texttt{if $x \in$ \{French, American\} go left
  else if $x \in$ \{Panamanian\} go right else raise NoSuchCategory}.
In this example, $C_L =$ \texttt{\{French, American\}} and $C_R =$
\texttt{\{Panamanian\}}.  For a categorical feature with $B$
categories, there are $2^B - 2$ ways to partition these into two sets.
A naive approach would be to evaluate every partition, and pick the
one associated with the smallest loss.  However, for even a modest
$B$, this can be quite expensive.  Fortunately, a heuristic which
imposes an order on the categories exists; with this ordering,
computing $\hat \gamma$'s and associated loss is nearly identical to
that of an ordinal features.

In the context of non-boosted trees, the idea is use the response $y$
determine the order -- after all, we want to use the feature to
discriminate between $y=1$ and $y=-1$.  Stated differently, in an
ideal partition, the response on one side will be uniformly $1$ and on
the other uniformly $-1$.

In the context boosted trees, we do not care about the response $y_i
\in {-1,1}$ but rather the pseudo-response $z_i \in \Re$, because the
latter reflects that which has not yet been explained by previous
trees.  Why does Friedman call
\[
z_i \equiv \frac{ 2 y_i } { 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] }
\]
the pseudo-response?  First note that $z_i$ is some $y_i$ scaled by
the positive quantity $2/( 1 + \exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ] )$.  we stated
earlier that when $y_i$ and $F_i^K$ have the same sign, then the
component of the loss $L(y_i,F_i^K)$ due to record $i$ is low (by
design) and that record is considered to be well explained.  In that
case, as $|F_i^K| \rightarrow \infty$, $\exp [ 2 y_i F_i^K ]
\rightarrow \infty$, and $z_i \rightarrow 0$.  Conversely for poorly
explained records, $y_i$ and $F_i^K$ have opposite signs, $\exp [ 2
  y_i F_i^K ] \rightarrow 0$ and $z_i \rightarrow 2 y_i$.

By ordering the categories according to the average of $z_i$ in each
category, that is
\[
\frac{1}{\text{card}(S)} N \equiv \frac{1}{\text{card}(S)} \sum_{i \in S} z_i
\]
We can find the split among the categories which clusters the
unexplained responses of each type ${-1,1}$.

\paragraph{Shrinkage and Stochastic Boosting}

In his follow-on paper \cite{SGB}, Friedman improved tree-boosting in
two ways.  The first idea is to train each tree (produced in a single
iteration) on a different, random subset of the training set ({\bf
stochastic}).  The second idea is to shrink the leaf values by some
scalar $\alpha < 1$.

The stochastic idea is inspired by the common practice in statistics
of setting aside data for model validation.  Predictive modeling
algorithms can easily {\bf overfit}, by which we mean that they pay
too much attention to the records in the training set, and in the
process degrade their ability to perform well on data that they have
not seen.  So, using the same set of records for both model assessment
and development often leads to a very optimistic view of a model's
performance.  A validation set consisting of records that are hidden
during model development can provide a more realistic view of the
model's performance.  In tree boosting, training on a different random
subset of records is intended to mitigate overfitting.  Experience
shows that it has the intended effect.

The second idea is to shrink in magnitude the value of each tree (that
is, replace the $\hat \gamma$'s that are at the leaf of every tree
with a scaled version, $\alpha \hat \gamma$ where $0 < \alpha < 1$.
This is inspired by common practice in optimization algorithms, where
a {\bf step}, intended to bring the algorithm closer to the solution,
is scaled back.  In \texttt{dawg}, a step is a tree.  The impact of
scaling each tree with the shrinkage factor $\alpha$ (also known as
the {\bf learning rate}) is to (a) slow down the algorithm (b) give
opportunities for a wider set of features to be included in the model,
resulting in a superior model (c) promote convergence.

It has been shown, both in academic papers, and by applying
\texttt{dawg} to various data sets, that shrinkage and stochastic
boosting used in combination leads to higher quality models.  These
runtime costs are significant, and the code necessary to implement
these features is more complex.

The point about convergence deserves some elaboration.  It is possible
that for some learning rate $\alpha \le 1$ the loss $Q \rightarrow
\infty$.  This happens typically because $L(y_i, F_i^K) \rightarrow
\infty$ for some record $i$ which was held out during the last
iteration $K$.  \texttt{dawg} detects to this situation by restarting
learning with a rate half the original one.

\paragraph{Algorithm Termination}

Although shrinkage and stochastic boosting reduce the tendency for
\texttt{dawg} to overfit, they do not eliminate that tendency.  In an
ideal world without overfitting, \texttt{dawg}'s loss function would
simply stop decreasing with each iteration $k$, defining a convenient
termination point.  However, with enough diverse features, it seems
possible to drive the loss arbitrarily close to zero.  This raises the
question: for a given learning rate, what is the optimal number of
trees (iterations) ?  To answer this question, \texttt{dawg} performs
k-fold cross-validation: it trains internally on $(k-1)$ folds, and
monitors the loss on the remaining ``validation'' fold.  Once the loss
on this fold starts increasing, \texttt{dawg} stops learning.
\texttt{dawg} constructs $k$ such sub-models, and averages them in a
final model.

During the validation phase, we can speak of several sets of records.
The training set is the union of the validation set and the working
set.  In each iteration of the validation phase, the working set is
randomly partitioned in two.  One partition is used for building a
tree, and the other partition is unused.  The partition of records
which are used are further portioned as splits are discovered.
